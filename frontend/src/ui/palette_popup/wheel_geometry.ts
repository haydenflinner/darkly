 * land in, never narrower than the parent, never more than a half turn, and
 * never too narrow for the longest name it holds. A parent with
 * `spread: 'full'` instead hands its children the entire circumference, which
 * no name could improve on.
 *
 * `widths` carries each label's rendered length, by label string. A fan is
 * measured once against them and spends the answer twice: on the arc it is
 * dealt, and on how much of that arc the member under the pen takes from its
 * siblings. Only a child fan spends it the first way; a section's arc is fixed
 * at registration. Passing no widths (or widths that all fit) yields exactly
 * the even layout above, which is both the pre-measurement frame and every
 * uncrowded wheel.
 *

 * is laid out, so a fan is dealt about its parent's *widened* midpoint and at

 * pack and no narrower than it, and it is why this is one pass rather than a
 * layout followed by a correction.

 * different halves of the question: `path` is the chain of *branches* the
 * painter has opened, and a leaf never joins it (`advance` drops it), so a
 * widening keyed on `path` alone could never select a brush. Extending it means
 * a pack keeps its place in the chain while the pen is out among its brushes,
 * so the pack stays wide *and* the brush under the pen widens. Which rings are
 * drawn at all, and which of them is unbounded, still follow `path`.
