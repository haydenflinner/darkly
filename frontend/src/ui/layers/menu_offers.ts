/**
 * What a layer row's context menu offers, and under which name.

/**
 * Whether the layer row offers to bake a node into plain pixels, and under
 * which name.
 *
 * One action (`flatten`) with two names, because it answers two questions: a
 * layer that owns its pixels and carries a mask gets **Flatten** (bake the mask
 * in), and a layer whose pixels are generated (a smart object, a camera void,
 * a text layer) gets **Rasterize**, the verb every editor uses for it and the
 * answer to "why can't I paint on this?".
 *
 * The drift this guards against: the entry appeared for a smart object while
 * the handler still early-returned unless there was a mask, so clicking
 * Rasterize did nothing at all: no error, no change.
 *
 * A container is checked first and always gets **Flatten**. It has to be: a
 * group reports `paintable: false` (it owns no pixels of its own, see
 * `Document::pixel_buffer` returning `None` for `LayerNode::Group`), so falling
 * through would offer every group "Rasterize", which is not the verb for
 * collapsing a group into one layer.

 * answer and nothing else; restating the rule here would put it in two places
 * that can disagree.
 *
 * A multi-row selection is not offered: the conversion consumes one layer and
 * replaces it in its own slot, and "convert 3 layers" has no single meaning:
 * three separate smart objects and one merged object are both defensible, so
