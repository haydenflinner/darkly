/**
 * How the pack wheel's position relates to the brush list's.
 *
 * Pure (no DOM, no `$state`, no reactive imports), so it is testable in
 * Vitest's node environment. Same reason `grouping.ts` sits beside its
 * component rather than inside it.
 *
 * The wheel has uniform cards; the list has sections whose heights follow their
 * contents, so a 40-brush pack is ten times taller than a 4-brush one. The
 * relation between them is therefore **piecewise linear**, with a knot at every
 * section boundary: section `i`'s list extent maps onto the wheel's slot
 * `[i·cardAdvance, (i+1)·cardAdvance)`. A uniform wheel that still points at
 * the right place.
 *
 * **Everything anchors on the focus line**: the middle of each pane,
 * {@link FOCUS_LINE}. The whole model is one sentence: *the pack across the
 * middle of the list is the pack whose card is across the middle of the wheel.*
 * Mixing anchors is how the two panes come to disagree: highlight the section
 * under one coordinate while scrolling the wheel to another and the highlighted
 * card sits somewhere the wheel never scrolled to, which is what a jump target
 * aligned to the viewport top did for as long as this file existed.
 *
 * A card therefore tracks its pack's **centre**: the pack's whole extent maps
 * onto the half-card either side of its own card, so the card is centred when
 * the pack is, and hands over to its neighbour half a card either way. That
 * bound (half a card, never more) is what keeps the highlighted card the
 * nearest one to the line at every scroll position.

 * from a third read. A programmatic `scrollTop` write lands synchronously while
 * the `scroll` event it provokes does not, so the transforms described where
 * the cards had been rather than where they now were, for one painted frame per
 * write. Composing the four here means they cannot be fed different numbers.
 *
 * The driven pane's position is derived; the driver's is passed through
 * untouched, so nothing ever writes back to the pane under the artist's hand.
 * `curves` and `focused` are computed from the *results*, not the sample, so
 * they describe where the panes are going in this frame rather than where they

 * edge, projected by its own curve, instead of the upright box a tilted card
 * still reports.
 *
 * **Both ends abut; neither overlaps.** A pack's surface carries alpha, so it
 * may be painted over any pixel once and only once: two of them stacked is not
 * the same colour twice, it is a darker colour, and an overlap is a strip of
 * that darker colour down the very join the projection exists to make
 * invisible. A band used to run a few pixels under its section to buy immunity
 * to the half-pixel seam subpixel layout can open between boxes that merely
 * abut. That trade only held while every surface was opaque: it exchanges a
 * seam that might appear for a doubling that always does, and it showed on
 * every pack except the derived ones, which wear the theme's opaque greys. Two
 * edges on one measured coordinate antialias to full coverage between them, and
 * whatever residue is left is a fraction of a tint rather than a tint twice.
 *
 * A pack contributes nothing when either end has scrolled out of its pane,
 * which is what makes the set of bands change continuously: one shrinks away as
 * its last row leaves while the next grows from nothing.
