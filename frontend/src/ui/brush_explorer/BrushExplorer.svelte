    /**
     * The brush explorer: a near-fullscreen modal for finding a brush.
     *
     * Two scroll-synced panes. On the left a rolodex of packs, which is both a
     * minimap of where you are and a way to get somewhere: tap a card to jump,
     * or fling it once there are more packs than fit. On the right every brush
     * in the library, grouped by pack, scrolling continuously from top to
     * bottom, with a search field. The point is that finding a brush never
     * requires first finding its pack: type, or scroll, or both.
     *
     * It takes the whole screen because picking a brush closes it, so the space
     * costs nothing. It is *not* dismissed by an outside pointerdown: that is
     * what made the old dropdown impossible to use with a pen, since resting a
     * hand closed it.
     *
     * Both panes are real scrollports, so pen and touch momentum come from the
     * platform on either side. What keeps them from oscillating is that only
     * one of them is ever *driven*: `driver` names the pane the artist has their
     * hand on, taken from input events, and each frame the other pane is moved
     * to match it. Nothing is derived from a `scroll` event (they only mark
     * the frame loop as live), because a programmatic `scrollTop` write lands
     * synchronously while its `scroll` event does not, and anything computed
     * from the event describes a position the pane has already left.

         * A box background is snapped to whole device pixels before it is
         * painted; a `clip-path` is rasterised against its own geometry and
         * antialiased. The band arrives here as a path, so off 100% zoom the
         * section's snapped edge and the band's unsnapped one land on the same
         * device column with different coverage: a sliver painted twice, or
         * one left bare, flipping between the two as the zoom moves the join
         * across the grid. That is the seam, and it is a disagreement about
         * *rasterisation*, not about position: the coordinate the two share is
         * already exact.
         *
         * Clipping the section puts its edge in the same regime as the band's.
         * Two antialiased edges on one coordinate carry complementary coverage,
         * which for surfaces at alpha `a` composites to `a − a²·t(1−t)`: under
         * a percent of the tint, against the half-pixel of doubling or bare
         * background that the mismatch produced.
         *
         * The card end has always resolved this way and has never shown the
         * seam, which is the evidence for this being the mechanism: a card is a
         * *transformed* element, so the compositor already antialiases its edge
         * against its geometry rather than snapping it. This gives the section
         * the same property by the means available to an untransformed box.
         *
         * The clip covers the pseudo-elements too, so the surface, the beam and
         * the rim all arrive at the join the same way. */

    /* Where this section samples the field: the same one the card and the
     * ribbon paint, anchored to the viewport rather than to this box.
     *
     * `fixed` is what makes the light belong to the explorer instead of to the
     * section. The positioning area becomes the viewport, so the image does not
     * move when the list scrolls and the section slides across a stationary
     * field: the effect stated once, by the surface itself, rather than
     * maintained.
     *
     * The alternative is to counter-offset `background-position` by the scroll
     * position, which has to be published from JavaScript once a frame. The list
     * is a native scrollport, so the compositor advances it without waiting for
     * that frame: on every frame the hand is on this pane, the published offset
     * describes where the section *was*, and the light drags along with the
     * packs and snaps back when they stop. A value the compositor cannot get
     * ahead of has no such frame.
     *
     * `--field-x` / `--field-y` are the explorer's own top-left in viewport
     * coordinates, measured beside the rest of the layout, so nothing about the
     * field is on the frame loop at all. They are constant between resizes
     * because a resize is the only thing that can move the box: `Modal`'s
     * `draggable` defaults off and the explorer does not set it. A draggable
     * explorer would have to remeasure on the drag.
     *
     * No border on the leading edge, so no rim there: that edge is where the
     * projection lands, and it is interior to the pack.
     *
     * The body ramp cannot be held still the same way: there is no
     * `mask-attachment`, so a mask is always anchored to the box it masks. It
     * does not need to be: the ramp runs left to right and this pane scrolls up
     * and down, so only its x has to land, and `--section-left` puts the ramp's
     * origin on the explorer's left edge where the beam's already is. The y is
     * free, which is why it is zero rather than a number nobody would be able
