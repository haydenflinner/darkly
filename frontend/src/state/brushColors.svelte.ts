/**
 * Per-brush color memory: the paint stays on the brush.
 *
 * A real brush carries whatever paint it was last dipped in, so picking it up
 * again brings that color back. This module remembers, per brush id, the
 * foreground/background pair the brush was last used with. `BrushGraphState`
 * records the outgoing brush's pair on every switch (locked or not, so
 * turning the lock on later already has history) and restores the incoming
 * brush's pair when `colors.lockToBrush` is set.
 *
 * Keyed by brush id rather than name so a rename keeps the memory. Module
 * level rather than per `DarklyInstance`: brushes are global, and the
 * metaphor is paint on the brush, not on the canvas.
 *
 * This is session state under the Document Authority principle: it must not
 * ride a `.darkly` file (it is not part of the document) and it cannot be
 * rebuilt from one (it is not compositor state), so it lives for the tab's
 * lifetime only. The lock itself is a preference and lives in config; this
 * module never consults it, so the policy stays at the one call site and the
 * memory stays a plain map.
