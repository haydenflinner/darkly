/**
 * Structural queries over a serialized layer tree, and the rule for picking a
 * replacement row when the active one disappears.
 *
 * The reselection rule follows GIMP and Krita, which agree on it exactly:
 * nearest surviving sibling **below** → nearest surviving sibling **above** →
 * the **parent** → nothing, scoped to the dead row's own sibling list and
 * computed against the tree as it was *before* the removal.
 *
 * - GIMP: `gimp_item_tree_remove_item`, `app/core/gimpitemtree.c`: captures the
 *   index before removal, re-reads that index in the shrunk container (= the
 *   sibling below), `CLAMP`s to the last child (= the sibling above, when the
 *   removed row was bottom-most), else selects the parent.
 * - Krita: `LayerBox::slotAboutToRemoveRows`,
 *   `plugins/dockers/layerdocker/LayerBox.cpp`: row `end + 1`, else row
 *   `start - 1`, else an invalid index, which `KisNodeModel::setData` resolves
 *   to the captured parent.
 *
 * Making the reselected row visible also follows GIMP, whose tree view expands
 * the parent of every newly selected item
 * (`gimp_container_tree_view_selection_changed`, `app/widgets/gimpcontainertreeview.c`).
 *
 * Direction convention: index 0 of any `children` array is the **top** of the
 * stack, so a higher index is lower in the panel and "sibling below" is the next
 * higher index. See `docs/coordinate-systems.md` and the double `.rev()` in
 * `crates/darkly/src/engine/veils.rs` + `engine/types.rs`.
