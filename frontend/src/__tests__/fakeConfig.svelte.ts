/**
 * Stand-in for the WASM-backed config store, for tests that mount components
 * reading prefs.
 *
 * It mirrors the one contract of the real store that callers actually depend
 * on: `get` is reactive. `ConfigStore` reads a `$state` version counter on
 * every `get` and bumps it on every mutation (`config/store.svelte.ts:47,136`),
 * which is what lets a `$derived` over a pref recompute when the pref changes.
 * A plain object cannot do that, and a module-level `$derived` reading one
 * caches its first value forever.
