//! The generated regions of this repository's own markdown, checked against the
//! registries they are generated from.
//!
//! `docs_md`'s unit tests cover the machinery: the marker grammar, relative
//! links, idempotence. What is left is the part that can only be asserted
//! against the checkout: that what is committed matches what the registries say
//! today, and that everything those regions point a reader at exists.
//!
//! Needs no GPU. That is the whole reason the text half and the image half are
//! separate commands: this runs in the ordinary suite, on every change to any
//! registration, which is exactly when a README drifts.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo test -p darkly --test docs_md`
