//! `category` is what the user reads; it is not what the engine acts on.
//!
//! One registry replaced two, so the split a user sees between Filters and
//! Veils is now a declaration rather than a structure. These tests pin both
//! halves of that: that the declaration partitions the catalog exactly, and
//! that nothing behavioural is allowed to read it.
//!
//! The second is the load-bearing one. A category that quietly gated
//! capability would rebuild the two subsystems this work removed, one field at
//! a time, and it would do so invisibly, which is the failure mode CLAUDE.md's
//! type-owned-dispatch rule names.
