//! The rendered documentation assets: that every previewable entry declares a
//! preview, that what it renders moves, and that what lands on disk is what the
//! catalogs said it would be.
//!
//! Two groups live here. The first is GPU-free and reads the registries: what an
//! entry *declares* (that it has a preview, how long it runs, whether it closes)
//! is data, and can be checked before a device is touched.
//!
//! The second group renders. Motion itself is a method rather than a
//! declaration, so there is nothing left to inspect statically and the pixels
//! are the only witness; `tests/picker_preview.rs` holds the finer-grained half
//! of that, over the same driver. Those tests share one fixture that runs the
//! whole walk once for the test binary rather than once per test, and tests that
//! only need a single entry call `render_entry` directly and skip the PNG
//! round-trip entirely.
//!
//! Run with: `cargo test -p darkly --features testing --test docs_render -- --test-threads=1`
