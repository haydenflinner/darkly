// Procedural `r(θ)` shape prelude: shared by compute-path brushes that
// stamp the same family of polar-radius silhouettes the `circle` fragment
// node produces.
//
// Functions here are parameterised on a `ShapeParams` struct so the same
// math can be reused by multiple terminals without a tight coupling to a
// shader-global `u`. The terminal that includes this prelude is
// responsible for building a `ShapeParams` for each dab (typically from
// its own dab record).
//
// **Bit-exact parity with `crates/darkly/src/brush/nodes/circle.rs`** is
// load-bearing: the CPU-side `integrate_centroid` walks the same `r(θ)`
// at a finer resolution, and per-pixel render tests catch drift as a
// mismatch. Keep the `hash1d` / `fbm_1d` / `r_sine` / `r_perlin` /
// `r_superformula` formulas here byte-equivalent to `circle.rs`.
//
// Include via `concat!()` at the consumer site:
//
//   concat!(
//       include_str!("../../../../../shaders/source_over.wgsl"),
//       "\n",
//       include_str!("../../../../../shaders/brush/_shape.wgsl"),
//       "\n",
//       include_str!("../../../../../shaders/brush/<terminal>.wgsl"),
//   )
//
// Scope: shape-radius only. The soft-disc coverage function (`r_solid` +
// linear falloff) is small enough that each terminal that needs it
// inlines its own copy. Coverage *math* is per-terminal; *radius* math is
// shared.
