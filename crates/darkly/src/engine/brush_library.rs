///
/// A squashed nib is inscribed in the dab radius, so anisotropy costs no
/// headroom: what a tip can add is a shape's bounded radial perturbation
/// (`circle`'s amplitude, ≤ 1.5×) and any future displacement node's padding,

/// ≈ 116 px reach inside the 896 px half-canvas, far less than this constant
