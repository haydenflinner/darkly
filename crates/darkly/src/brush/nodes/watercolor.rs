//! Watercolor terminal: two-pass batched watercolor with a per-brush
//! compiled composite shader.
//!
//! Structural shape mirrors [`paint`](super::paint),
//! with one extra pass at the front:
//!
//! 1. **Pickup atlas pass.** One instanced draw, N quads: each writes the
//!    8×8 alpha-weighted neighborhood average of the *pre-stroke snapshot*
//!    at the dab's footprint into its cell in a 128×128 atlas. That is the
//!    dry colour the pigment mixes away from, and it is frozen for the
//!    whole stroke: buildup across passes comes from the deposit channel
//!    below, not from feeding the mark back into its own input. The shader
//!    is brush-agnostic in math but built per-brush so its `DabRecord`
//!    struct stride matches the compiled brush's. Cell layout is
//!    `(idx % atlas_w, idx / atlas_w)`.
//! 2. **Composite pass, one draw per dab.** The fragment shader is the
//!    framework-assembled per-brush WGSL: upstream nodes (`circle`,
//!    `paint_color`, etc.) compile inline; this terminal contributes the
//!    watercolor blend math and the `@group(3)` bindings.
//!
//! ## How a mark builds up
//!
//! The scratch carries *coverage* and saturates almost immediately. How
//! much pigment has been delivered is a second, independent quantity, and
//! it lives in a [`StrokeChannel`] hung off the composite draw as a second
//! colour attachment (see [`DEPOSIT_CHANNEL`]). Each dab folds its own
//! delivery rate in under source-over, giving `1 − Π(1−rᵢ)`, and reads the
//! value under itself to decide how far from the dry canvas toward the
//! pigment its colour sits. A texel touched once sits near the canvas; one
//! dwelt on converges on the brush colour.
//!
//! A dab reads that field **once**, at its own centre, and resolves one
//! solid colour before it goes down. The stamp is flat; only its coverage
//! varies across the footprint. See `compile_wgsl`.
//!
//! ## Differences from `watercolor_batched`
//!
//! - **Shape lives upstream.** `watercolor_batched` had `algorithm`,
//!   `amplitude`, `frequency`, etc. as ports on the terminal and
//!   evaluated the procedural shape inline. Here the upstream graph
//!   provides a scalar `mask` input (typically wired from
//!   `circle.mask`), and the composite's fragment shader inlines
//!   whatever WGSL the circle node emits.
//! - **No CPU centroid integration.** `watercolor_batched` integrated
//!   the asymmetric shape's centroid on the CPU and packed it into
//!   the dab record to pin the shape to the pen tip. The compiled
//!   `circle` currently emits its silhouette centered on the local origin
//!   without translation. If the compiled shape's centroid drifts off
//!   the pen tip noticeably, restoring a centroid step is a focused
//!   follow-up.
//! - **Bind groups.** The framework's three (uniforms, dabs,
//!   selection) plus `@group(3)` for the pickup atlas. Declared via
//!   `NodeWgsl.terminal_bindings` so the extension stays scoped to
//!   this one terminal.

        // scratch in the ROP.
        //
        // That is why `prior` is read at `d.pos` (the dab's own centre)
        // and not at `target_pos`. Reading the deposit per *fragment* makes
        // `load_rgb` vary across the footprint, and since neighbouring dabs
        // then disagree about the colour of the texels they share, the mark
        // comes out mottled at dab frequency even though the deposit field
        // itself is smooth. One read per dab keeps each stamp flat, and the
        // gradient across the stroke comes from consecutive dabs differing
        // by one `deposit` step, which is what makes it look continuous.
        //
        // **`deposit` is per pass of the brush, not per dab.** An artist
        // setting 30% means a stroke over black leaves 30% grey, and that
        // has to hold whatever the spacing is. A dab is not a unit anyone
        // can see: at the default 10% spacing ten of them land on every
        // texel, so charging `deposit` once per dab compounds it ten times
        // and 30% arrives as 87%. Worse, spacing is a fraction of dab
        // *diameter* and diameter tracks pressure, so the overlap count
        // (and with it the meaning of the knob) drifts inside a single
        // stroke.
        //
        //     per_dab = 1 − (1 − deposit)^(1/dabs_per_pass)
        //
        // inverts that exactly: `dabs_per_pass` of them compose back to
        // `deposit`, and the result no longer depends on how finely the
        // stroke was subdivided.
        //
        // `rate` deliberately carries no `mask`. The shape's falloff would
        // make the outer dabs deliver less than `per_dab`, so a pass would
        // land short of `deposit` by an amount set by the tip's softness:
        // the knob would drift again, this time per brush. The mark still
        // gets its soft edge, from `fg_a`; what the channel records is how
        // many times the brush passed over a texel, which is the quantity
        // the rate is stated against. Coverage stays in `fg_a`, delivery
        // stays in `rate`.
        //
        // `flow` scales the delivery rate only, and is not folded into
        // `fg_color.a` as well: one knob, counted once.
