//! User Input node: a labelled dial the brush author places in the graph and
//! wires to as many inputs as they like.
//!
//! The graph could already fan one control out to several sinks by exposing a
//! math node's input and wiring its output around (place a `multiply`, leave
//! `b` at its identity, expose `a`), but that costs a node whose arithmetic is
//! a no-op and whose name says "Multiply" when it means "knob". This node says
//! it directly.
//!
//! It carries no params. Everything an author would want to author about the
//! dial (its label, description, icon, slider range, inversion, display unit)
//! is already per-instance state on the brush-bar entry, reachable from the
//! entry modal, so putting any of it here would store the same fact twice.
//!
//! The whole node is one settable-source input. `PortDef::source` lets an
//! input keep its scrubbable authored value while other nodes wire *from* it,
//! and the rest of the stack is generic over that: the compiler gives it an
//! output slot, `execute_cpu` republishes its resolved value onto that slot,
//! and the brush bar disqualifies an entry only for *incoming* wires. So a
//! dial with ten outgoing wires is still a dial.
//!
//! `persist_in_thumbnail` is load-bearing. `reset_exposed_scrubs` neutralises
//! exposed ports back to their registration defaults before baking a brush's
//! picker thumbnail, so the icon shows brush identity rather than a momentary
//! scrub. For a generic dial that would be backwards: the registration default
//! is an arbitrary mid-travel number and the author's value *is* the identity.
