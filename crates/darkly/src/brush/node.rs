//! Brush-flavoured wrapper around the generic [`NodeRegistration`].
//!
//! Each brush node module's `register()` returns a [`BrushNodeRegistration`].
//! Compared to the bare nodegraph registration, this wrapper also carries:
//!
//! - the GPU pipeline registrations the node owns (zero, one, or more),
//! - a constructor for the node's CPU/GPU evaluator (a trait object), and
//! - the node's stroke-lifecycle hook (clear scratch / seed from pre-stroke / none).
//!
//! Bundling the evaluator constructor here is the load-bearing design choice
//! that lets [`crate::brush::BrushNodeRegistry`] be the single source of
//! truth for "what nodes exist?": there is no parallel hand-written
//! evaluator map to keep in sync. See CONTRIBUTING.md "Modularity Principle".
//!
//! The nodegraph compiler only knows about [`NodeRegistration<W>`]; the
//! brush layer unwraps `.node` when feeding it into the compiler.  The
//! brush pipeline registry harvests `.pipelines` from every node at
//! [`BrushPipelines::new`](super::pipeline::BrushPipelines::new) time.
