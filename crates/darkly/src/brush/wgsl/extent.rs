//! Extent protocol: composition of per-node dab-bbox contributions.
//!
//! Every node declares an [`ExtentContribution`] describing how it grows
//! / clips the upstream dab bbox. [`compose_brush_extent`] walks the
//! execution plan in topological order and composes them into a single
//! `(factor, extra_px)` pair stored on
//! [`crate::brush::wgsl::CompiledBrush`]; the `paint` terminal multiplies
//! the per-dab effective radius by `factor` and adds `extra_px` to
//! produce the dab's `bbox_target_px`. That value is packed into the
//! per-dab record and read by the WGSL fragment shader to size the
//! rasterized quad and to clip the dab's write footprint to the layer
//! bbox.
//!
//! Because the value flows from the framework into both the CPU bbox
//! computation and the GPU shader (via the dab record), the CPU bbox
//! and shader write footprint cannot diverge.

/// layer-clip bbox used the un-inflated `radius`. On a mid-stroke
/// save-point rewind, the save-point system cleared pixels outside the
/// CPU bbox but only restored into it, so anything the shader wrote in
/// the inflation margin was lost, visibly truncating previous dabs to a
/// smaller square as the artist kept drawing.
