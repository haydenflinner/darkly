//! Scratch: the writable stroke scratch and its read-mirror sibling.
//!
//! WebGPU forbids reading and writing the same texture in a single render
//! pass.  Brush composite shaders need both: they read existing pixels at
//! the dab's footprint (to source-over blend the new dab on top) and write
//! the blended result.  Same texture, both directions, in one pass: illegal.
//!
//! `Scratch` works around this by owning two textures:
//!
//! - **Write side** (`write_texture`): dabs render here.  Sized to the layer
//!   so every layer-local pixel a dab can land on is addressable.  Grows
//!   when the layer grows (via [`Scratch::grow_write`], driven from
//!   `painting.rs::ensure_layer_covers_dab`).  Contents preserved on grow
//!   (in-flight stroke pixels mustn't be lost).
//!
//! - **Read mirror** (`read_mirror_texture`): a per-dab snapshot of the
//!   write side under the dab's footprint.  Sized to the largest dab
//!   footprint seen this stroke; grown lazily inside [`Scratch::sync_read_mirror`]
//!   when a footprint exceeds the current size.  Never preserved across
//!   grow; overwritten by the very next sync.  Per-dab origin tracked so
//!   multiple GPU nodes per dab (color_output + watercolor pickup, etc.)
//!   share one copy.
//!
//! The two sides are managed atomically by this type: there is no public
//! API by which a caller can resize one without going through `Scratch`.
//!
//! There are two ways to read the in-flight scratch, and which one applies
//! is decided by the reader's own render target:
//!
//! - A pass that **also writes** the scratch (its color attachment is
//!   [`Scratch::write_view`]) must go through [`Scratch::sync_read_mirror`].
//!   Sampling the write side from such a pass is the R/W alias WebGPU
//!   forbids; the mirror is what makes it legal.
//! - A pass that **does not** target the scratch may sample the write side
//!   directly via [`Scratch::live_canvas_bind_group`]: no alias, no copy.
//!   Watercolor's pickup atlas pass does this: it renders to the atlas and
//!   reads the scratch to see the wet paint under each dab.
//!
//! The mirror is the more expensive of the two (a `copy_texture_to_texture`
//! per dab), so prefer the direct read whenever the target allows it.
//!
//! Ownership: owned by `StrokeBuffer`, allocated at stroke start, freed at
//! stroke end.
