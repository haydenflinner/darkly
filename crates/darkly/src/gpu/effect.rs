//! The one kind of image transform Darkly has: an **effect**.
//!
//! An effect is a registered, parameterized transform of an image: a
//! `type_id`, a [`ParamDef`] schema, a WGSL pipeline and a preview. One
//! instance exists per place the effect is used; the pipeline behind it is
//! `Arc`'d by [`EffectRegistry`] and shared across every instance of its type
//! and target format.
//!
//! The same instance serves every path an effect can be invoked through
//! (a layer in the tree, the screen-space chain, a destructive apply over a
//! node region, a picker preview) because all four hand it a ping-pong pair
//! and ask it to write one half from the other. Masking is **not** the
//! effect's concern: it is applied outside, by the shared in-place apply pass,
//! which is what makes every effect maskable without declaring anything.
//!
//! Modules live in `gpu/effects/`, one file each, discovered by `build.rs`.
